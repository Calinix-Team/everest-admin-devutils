# Tools and Scripts for Admins of Everest Store

These are some basic scripts I use as an Everest store admin to make work easier

Run `install.sh` to get the scripts installed on your system

- `getlocalpkg` - Search for package binaries and return available links (Never select *.sig files for Binary)
